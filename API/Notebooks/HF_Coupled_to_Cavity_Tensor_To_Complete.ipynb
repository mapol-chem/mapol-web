You can see that the ground state of the coupled system is quite close, but just a little above, the uncoupled ground state.  However, there is a striking difference in the 1st and second excited states of the coupled system, which are the polariton states that are split below and above the 1st excited state of the uncoupled system.

    "The Harmonic approximation neglects important features of the vibrational structure of molecules.  In particular, the Harmonic approximation does not permit dissociation of chemical bonds, does not adequately capture the fact that higher vibrational states are associated with average and most probable bond lengths that are stretched from equilibrium, does predict distinct vibrational transition energies seen in hot bands, and does not predict that overtone transitions can be spectroscopically excited.  \n",

    "While beyond the scope of this primer, we wish to point out that the code above can be adapted to model potentials that capture anhoarmonic effects and that can recover the features described above.  There are a couple of trade offs that we wish to point out if one develops these models for general anharmonic oscillator potential.  The first trade off is that the simple rules of the ladder operators that enabled simple construction of the bare matter Hamiltonian, the dipole self energy, and the coupling matrices will no longer be suitable for anharmonic oscillators, and so one will have to adapt the construction of these operators accordingly.  The second tradeoff is that the eigenspectra of the p dot A and Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonians will typically not agree with each other at the same level of basis truncation.  They will converge to the same spectra in the complete basis limit, but depending on how strong the coupling is (i.e. the magnitude of ${\\bf A}_0$, agreement between the two spectra may require a very large number of basis states for the matter and photonic subsystems.\n",

    "# Modeling Electronic Strong Coupling\n",
    "While we have focused specifically on vibrational strong coupling in this notebook and in Chapter 2 of this primer, the formalism presented can also be applied to electronic strong coupling.  We direct the interested reader to an example where the magnesium hydride cation is coupled through an electronic transition to a cavity mode at ultraviolet frequencies [here](https://github.com/FoleyLab/MolSSI-MAPOL-Charlotte-CMS/blob/main/polariton_project/polariton_data/MgH_polaritonic_for_solutions.ipynb).  Just as in the Morse oscillator case, one will sacrifice simple analytical terms for the bilinear coupling and dipole self energy terms, but further, one will sacrifice analytical expressions even for the matter energy eigenstates.  In the linked notebook, we obtain energies and transition dipole moments from the time-dependent density functional theory formalism for the magnesium hydride subsystem, and use those quantities to parameterize our coupled model.  We also note that in this notebook, we effectively implement the Jaynes-Cummings model, which neglects the dipole self energy (and certain bilinear coupling elements known as the counter-rotating terms).  We encourage the interested reader to work through this example, and consider adding dipole self energy and counter rotating terms to evaluate their impact for different coupling strengths!"
